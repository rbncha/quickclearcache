===============

This fairly simple tiny extension to clear all types of core caches right from any admin page. It adds 3 buttons &quot;Clear All Cache&quot;, &quot;Flush Magento Cache&quot; and &quot;Flush Cache Storage&quot; at the right top side of header in every admin pages. I hope this can be convenient for developers, however a non technical can also use it to clear cache.

This extension is compatible from Magento 1.8.x - 1.9.x versions
